This is an EMPTY PLACEHOLDER file.

Replace this file with your real MSI named exactly:
  payloads/MyProduct.msi

Notes:
- Git repositories often ignore/balk at committing large binary MSIs. Consider using:
  - a build pipeline that produces the MSI, or
  - Git LFS, or
  - a smaller sample MSI.

Once replaced, the WiX bundle project (src/Bundle) references it from Bundle.wxs.
